/**
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Parking Charges.
 *
 * A parking garage charges a $20.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours.
 * The garage charges an additional $5.00 per hour for each hour or part
 * thereof in excess of three hours. The maximum charge for any given 24-hour
 * period is $50.00. Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a
 * time. Write a program that calculates and prints the parking charges for
 * each of three customers who parked their cars in this garage yesterday. You
 * should enter the hours parked for each customer.
 *
 * Your program should print the results in a neat tabular format and should
 * calculate and print the total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts.
 * The program should use the function calculateCharges to determine the charge
 * for each customer. Your outputs should appear in the following format:
 *
 * Car      Hours        Charge
 * 1          1.5         20.00
 * 2          4.0         25.00
 * 3         24.0         50.00
 * TOTAL     29.5         95.50
