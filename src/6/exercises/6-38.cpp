/**
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Towers of Hanoi.
 *
 * In this chapter, you studied functions that can be easily implemented both
 * recursively and iteratively. In this exercise, we present a problem whose
 * recursive solution demonstrates the elegance of recursion, and whose
 * iterative solution may not be as apparent.
 *
 * The Towers of Hanoi is one of the most famous classic problems every budding
 * computer scientist must grapple with. Legend has it that in a temple in the
 * Far East, priests are attempting to move a stack of golden disks from one
 * diamond peg to another (Fig. 6.31). The initial stack has 64 disks threaded
 * onto one peg and arranged from bottom to top by decreasing size. The priests
 * are attempting to move the stack from one peg to another under the
 * constraints that exactly one disk is moved at a time and at no time may a
 * larger disk be placed above a smaller disk. Three pegs are provided, one
 * being used for temporarily holding disks. Supposedly, the world will end
 * when the priests complete their task, so there is little incentive for us to
 * facilitate their efforts.
 *
 * Letâ€™s assume that the priests are attempting to move the disks from peg 1 to
 * peg 3. We wish to develop an algorithm that prints the precise sequence of
 * peg-to-peg disk transfers.
 *
 * If we were to approach this problem with conventional methods, we would
 * rapidly find ourselves hopelessly knotted up in managing the disks. Instead,
 * attacking this problem with recursion in mind allows the steps to be simple.
 * Moving n disks can be viewed in terms of moving only n - 1 disks (hence, the
 * recursion), as follows:
 *
 * Move n - 1 disks from peg 1 to peg 2, using peg 3 as a temporary holding
 * area.
 *
 * Move the last disk (the largest) from peg 1 to peg 3.
 *
 * Move the n - 1 disks from peg 2 to peg 3, using peg 1 as a temporary holding
 * area. The process ends when the last task involves moving n = 1 disk (i.e.,
 * the base case). This task is accomplished by simply moving the disk, without
 * the need for a temporary holding area. Write a program to solve the Towers
 * of Hanoi problem. Use a recursive function with four parameters:
 *
 * The number of disks to be moved
 *
 * The peg on which these disks are initially threaded
 *
 * The peg to which this stack of disks is to be moved
 *
 * The peg to be used as a temporary holding area
 *
 * Display the precise instructions for moving the disks from the starting peg
 * to the destination peg. To move a stack of three disks from peg 1 to peg 3,
 * the program displays the following moves:
 *
 * 1->3 (This means move one disk from peg 1 to peg 3.)
 * 1->2
 * 3->2
 * 1->3
 * 2->1
 * 2->3
 * 1->3
